Welcome!

I am a Political Science major at the University of California, Santa Barbara. My current interests are in American politics, elections, judicial politics, and political methodology. 

I am currently working on projects relating to electoral districts and social structures within the United States, polling place locations, and the overruling of precedent on the U.S. Supreme Court.
